> Central location for automation scripts and snippets relating to Nagios


As the Nagios community has grown, the need for automating Nagios-related
tasks has become increasingly common. Internally we've developed some scripts
that leverage existing automation frameworks and this repository serves as a
central hub of those scripts and snippets.


## Disclaimer

Many of these automation scripts are not production-grade. They are built to 
perform a specific task or to demonstrate specific functionality. They may or 
may not follow currently accepted best-practices.

***Please read through each script before attempting to use it in your 
environment.***

These scripts are provided "as is" *without warranty of any kind*, either
